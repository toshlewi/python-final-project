# 🦠 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

A comprehensive Jupyter Notebook project that analyzes global trends in COVID-19 infections, fatalities, and vaccination progress using real-time data from Our World in Data. This project features data loading, cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualizations, and global insights derived from multiple countries across different continents.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- To analyze the global progression of COVID-19 cases and deaths.
- To assess the effectiveness of vaccination efforts across different countries.
- To visualize trends using line charts, bar plots, and choropleth maps.
- To identify key metrics like case fatality rate and vaccination rate.
- To uncover insights into the relationship between population, infections, and vaccination coverage.

## 📊 Key Insights & Reflections

* The pandemic had distinct waves with varying peak timings across countries.
* Case fatality rates have generally declined over time due to improved treatments and vaccination.
* Higher population countries tend to have higher absolute case counts.
* There is a strong correlation between population, total cases, and vaccination progress.
* Vaccination rates vary widely, highlighting global disparities in healthcare access.
* Visualization tools like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly` greatly enhance understanding of global trends.
